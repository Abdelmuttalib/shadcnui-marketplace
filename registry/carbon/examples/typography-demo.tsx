        Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who
        spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him
        with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.

        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but
        the king was firm:

        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a
        gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's
        foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.

        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
        leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup,
        even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to
        stop Jokester.

      <Typography className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes
        left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And
        once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.
